# Paperplane photography theme
## A WordPress theme for photographers.
This theme needs [Advanced Custom Fields Pro](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/ "Advanced Custom Fields Pro") installed but can be adapted to manage options in others ways.<br/>
If you want to use Advanced Custom Fields Pro you can use "acf-export-fields.json" to import all required fields.<br/>
### The main objectives of this theme are:
* to allow the visualization of images without being cut on all devices;
* allow photographers maximum editorial control;
* web performance;
* indexing also on a site based mainly on images;

### Features:
* dark or clear mode navigation;
* toggle all unnecessary navigation information when viewing a photo;
* sell single picture trough PayPal;
* homepage layout adjustable to show one single random picture or a list of works;
* navigation between images is managed using the native system that WordPress uses to manage the attachments to a post;

### How to set it up:
* create a page and set "Home" as template;
* in WordPress "Settings > Reading" options set it as home page;
* go to "Theme settings" set "Theme version" (useful for forcing cache clearing) and links you want to appear in footer;
* go to "Site settings" and set both "Typographic" and "Image gallery" options;
