# Paperplane photography theme
## A WordPress theme for photographers.
This theme needs [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/ "Advanced Custom Fields") installed but can be adapted to manage options in others ways.<br/>
The main objective of this theme: to allow the visualization of images without being cut on all devices, allowing photographers maximum editorial control.<br/>
You can browse the site in dark or clear mode and even toggle all unnecessary navigation information when viewing a photo.<br/>
The navigation between the images is managed using the native system that WordPress uses to manage the attachments to a post.
