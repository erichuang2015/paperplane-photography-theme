# Paperplane photography theme
## A WordPress theme for photographers.
This theme needs Advanced Custom Fields installed but can be adapted to manage options in others ways.
The main objective of this theme: to allow the visualization of images without being cut on all devices, allowing photographers maximum editorial control.
You can browse the site in dark or clear mode and even toggle all unnecessary navigation information when viewing a photo.
The navigation between the images is managed using the native system that WordPress uses to manage the attachments to a post.
