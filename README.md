# Paperplane photography theme
## A WordPress theme for photographers.
This theme needs [Advanced Custom Fields](https://www.advancedcustomfields.com/pro/ "Advanced Custom Fields") installed but can be adapted to manage options in others ways. You can use "acf-export-fields.json" to import all required fields.<br/>
The main objectives of this theme are:
* to allow the visualization of images without being cut on all devices;
* allow photographers maximum editorial control;
* web performance
* indexing also on a site based mainly on images  

You can browse the site in dark or clear mode and even toggle all unnecessary navigation information when viewing a photo.<br/>
The navigation between the images is managed using the native system that WordPress uses to manage the attachments to a post.
